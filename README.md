# Predicting-Employee-Attrition
This project aims to predict employee attrition, a critical challenge faced by organizations globally. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can identify factors contributing to attrition and develop predictive models to anticipate employee departures.
# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
# Usage
1. Explore the Jupyter notebook Employee_Attrition_Prediction.ipynb for detailed analysis and code implementation.
2. Follow the step-by-step guide within the notebook to preprocess the data, visualize key insights, and build predictive models.
3. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
4. Evaluate the model using various metrics and visualize the results for interpretation.
5. Make predictions on new data and assess the potential for employee attrition.
